# Modern Admin Control Panel

Modern Admin Control Panel (MACP) is a new version of the legacy Control Panel, with which it exists in tandem. MACP came into existence from the Cumulative Update of July 2019, and it has undergone further enhancements in the Cumulative Update of November 2024. It helps manage the configuration of servers, users, clients, and devices in the environment of an organization. It has all the menu items that were present in the Legacy Control panel.

The legacy Control Panel might not work as Silverlight technology reached the "end-of-support" stage on October 12, 2021. For more information, see [Silverlight End of Support](https://support.microsoft.com/windows/silverlight-end-of-support-0a3be3c7-bead-e203-2dfd-74f0a64f1788).

> [!NOTE]
> We recommend you don't use the legacy Control Panel anymore, and disable it. For information on how to disable the legacy Control Panel, see [Disable Legacy Control Panel (CSCP)](/SkypeForBusiness/plan/disable-legacy-control-panel).

## Access Control Panel
