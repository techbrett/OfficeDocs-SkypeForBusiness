# Native Bluetooth personal peripherals for Microsoft Teams

Native Bluetooth personal peripherals refer to personal headsets or speakerphones that are directly paired and connected to the integrated Bluetooth radio of a host device, such as a PC or mobile phone, without requiring an adapter or also called a dongle. This article provides a comprehensive overview of Native Bluetooth personal peripherals and outlines the certification requirements necessary for compatibility with Microsoft Teams.

To see a list of supported Bluetooth personal peripherals, see [Certified personal peripherals](usb-devices.md?tabs=usb).

## Certification requirements

The certification program ensures that audio personal peripherals offer rich audio quality and full functionality with the Teams app experience. Functionalities included in this certification are:

- Calling
- Mute
- Teams button

Certified devices work with plug & play functionality with no extra configuration required and offer call control with Microsoft Teams. They also offer Mute sync status between the device and the Teams desktop client and vice versa. The certification program scope includes the use of the Teams desktop client only.

## Pairing Native Bluetooth peripherals to a Windows PC

To pair a Native Bluetooth Peripheral to your Windows 11 PC, start by ensuring that your peripheral and PC meets the minimum requirements.

1. Place the peripheral in pairing mode following the instructions from the manufacturer.
2. If the peripheral and your Windows PC support Swift Pair, you may see a notification prompting you to pair the device with a single select.
3. If you don't see this notification when the device enters pairing mode, the device can be paired manually through the **Settings** app. For more information about pairing Bluetooth peripherals with Windows, see [Pair a Bluetooth device in Windows - Microsoft Support](https://support.microsoft.com/windows/pair-a-bluetooth-device-in-windows-2be7b51f-6ae9-b757-a3b9-95ee40c3e242).

## Minimum Requirements

### Hardware Requirements

For a better and more consistent experience, ensure that you have the latest audio and Bluetooth drivers. PCs with Intel processors are recommended to use 12th Gen Intel processors or newer. Some Intel Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and audio drivers have known compatibility issues with Native Bluetooth peripherals. Review the minimum driver versions suggested in the [Known Issues](#known-issues) section.

PCs that don't come with integrated Bluetooth radios and use aftermarket USB Bluetooth adapters aren't recommended.

### OS and software requirements

- Windows: Windows 11
- macOS: Not supported yet

### Minimum Teams desktop app version

- Teams App version: 24335.208.3315.1951 or newer

## Known issues

- Teams button won't work consistently in the following cases:
  - Connecting more than one Bluetooth peripheral directly to the laptop at the same time.
  - Logging into more than one tenant under the same Teams desktop client.
  - When the Teams desktop client is closed and reopened, it needs a few seconds for the Teams button to work again. If this doesn't work, turn off and on your headset to resolve the issue.
- Mute status sync from the Teams desktop client to the device works only with Teams-certified peripherals.
- Some Intel driver versions are known to have compatibility issues. Ensure that your Intel-based PC has the following minimum driver versions before using Native Bluetooth peripherals:
  - Intel Smart Sound Technology (iSST):
    - Core Ultra 200V: 20.42.11233.0 or newer
    - Core Ultra: 20.40.11112.5 or newer
    - 12th Gen / 13th Gen: 10.29.00.11261 or newer
  - Intel Bluetooth: 23.70.x or newer
  - Intel Wi-Fi: 23.70.x or newer

### Checking driver versions

#### Checking iSST driver version

1. Open **Device Manager**.
2. Locate **Sound, Video, and Game Controllers** and expand it.
3. Find **Intel Smart Sound Technology (iSST)**.
4. Right-click and select **Properties** and go to the **Driver** tab to check the driver version.

#### Checking Intel Bluetooth driver version

1. Open **Device Manager**.
2. Locate **Bluetooth** and expand it.
3. Find **Intel(R) Wireless Bluetooth**.
4. Right-click and select **Properties** and go to the **Driver** tab to check the driver version.
5. Download the latest version from [Intel Wireless Bluetooth Drivers for Windows 10 and Windows 11](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/download/19351/intel-wireless-wi-fi-drivers-for-windows-10-and-windows-11.html?wapkw=wifi).

#### Checking Intel Wi-Fi driver version

1. Open **Device Manager**.
2. Locate **Network Adapters** and expand it.
3. Find **Intel(R) Wi-Fi Component**.
4. Right-click and select **Properties** and go to the **Driver** tab to check the driver version.
5. Download the latest version from [Intel Wireless Wi-Fi Drivers for Windows 10 and Windows 11](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/download/19351/intel-wireless-wi-fi-drivers-for-windows-10-and-windows-11.html?wapkw=wifi).

## Certified Native Bluetooth peripherals

This certification is currently for Classic Bluetooth devices. The Microsoft Teams Certification Program has not started certifying Bluetooth Low Energy (LE) Audio headsets yet. We will update this article when the time comes. We do not anticipate issues with headsets that support both Classic Bluetooth and Bluetooth LE Audio, but the latter mode is not certified for Teams.

To see a list of supported Bluetooth personal peripherals, see [Certified personal peripherals](usb-devices.md?tabs=usb).


## Troubleshooting

The performance of a peripheral in Native Bluetooth mode is impacted by the Bluetooth radio on the host PC. We recommend installing the latest firmware updates for both peripherals and Bluetooth radio.

If problems persist, start by reviewing the Bluetooth troubleshooting steps at [Fix Bluetooth problems in Windows - Microsoft Support](https://support.microsoft.com/help/14169/windows-10-fix-bluetooth-problems).

A small portion of users may need to continue to use a USB dongle to connect to the peripheral instead of using a Native Bluetooth connection to their Windows PC. This can happen in scenarios such as working in a high-density wireless environment, if the PC's Bluetooth radio is heavily used by multiple paired devices, or with certain PCs with older Bluetooth radios that are no longer receiving manufacturer support.
