# Answer Auto attendant and Call queue calls directly from Teams

Teams users can receive and answer calls from Cloud Auto attendants and Call queues directly from their Teams client.

## What are Auto attendants and Call queues?

Cloud Auto attendants provide a series of voice prompts or an audio file that callers hear instead of a human operator when they call in to an organization. An Auto attendant lets callers move through the menu system, place calls, or locate users by using a phone keypad (DTMF) or voice inputs using speech recognition.

Cloud Call queues include greetings that are used when someone calls in to a phone number for your organization, the ability to automatically put the calls on hold, and the ability to search for the next available call agent to handle the call while the people who call are listening to music on hold. You can create single or multiple Call queues for your organization.

## Handling an Auto attendant or Call queue call

Users can differentiate incoming calls from an Auto attendant or Call queue before they answer the call.

When agents receive a call from an auto attendant, the information in the toast contains the name or number of the caller and the display name of the resource account assigned to the Auto attendant that answered the call.

When agents in a call queue receive a call, the information in the toast is determined by how the call arrived in the queue.

- If the call was transferred to the call queue without a resource account, the agent receives the name of the call queue in the toast.
- If the call was transferred to the call queue through a resource account, the agents receives the display name of the resource account.

The following illustration shows how an incoming call from an Auto attendant or Call queue appears to a user.

Once an Auto attendant or Call queue call is answered, the user can process the call like any other call &#x2014; they can add or conference in another user or transfer the call to another party. Also, Auto attendant calls are forwarded based on the user's configuration.

> [!NOTE]
> Call queue calls aren't forwarded based on the user's call answering rules configuration. This ensures that callers remain in the queue until an agent can answer the call and that the caller isn't forwarded unexpectedly.
>
> Users receiving calls from Call queues are only presented with the name of the caller if it's provided from the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) or if the caller's number matches the target user's local Teams client contacts.
>
> Agents aren't notified of any missed calls or voicemails for Call queue calls.

## Configure Auto attendant and Call queue support for Microsoft Teams
