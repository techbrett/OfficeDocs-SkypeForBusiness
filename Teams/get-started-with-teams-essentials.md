# Microsoft Teams Essentials QuickStart guide for small businesses

Microsoft Teams Essentials is a standalone Teams subscription that provides an all-in-one solution with meetings, chat, and collaboration for small businesses. As your business adapts to the increased need for remote working and virtual connections, you may be searching for a way to securely collaborate with employees, partners, suppliers, and customers. Whether you're a multi-city bakery, or a nine-person event agency, Microsoft Teams Essentials can bring your business together through one connected experience.

## Before you continue

Microsoft Teams Essentials is available for purchase through Microsoft's direct website and select Microsoft Cloud Partners. Subscriptions through direct and partner differ in some ways because they use different identity systems. For more information, see [Microsoft Teams Essentials plans](#how-does-microsoft-teams-essentials-compare-to-other-microsoft-teams-plans).

A subscription purchased through Microsoft's direct website uses Microsoft account identity, which allows you to use your existing email address like `TomislavK@outlook.com`, `TomislavK@gmail.com`, or `TomislavK@ContosoLandscaping.com` to sign up.

Alternatively, Teams Essentials purchased through select Microsoft Certified Partners uses Microsoft Entra, which asks you to create a new login/identity. Partners can configure Teams Essentials to connect to your existing email address so you can sign in using your existing email address.  

## What Microsoft Teams Essentials subscription do I have?  

If you purchased Teams Essentials through Microsoft's website (direct), you own **Microsoft Teams Essentials**.

If you purchased Teams Essentials through a Microsoft Certified Partner, you own **Microsoft Teams Essentials (Microsoft Entra identity)**.

## How does Microsoft Teams Essentials compare to other Microsoft Teams plans?

To purchase the right Teams subscription for your organization, compare Teams features between Teams Essentials, Microsoft 365 Business Basic, and Microsoft 365 Business Standard at [Find the right Microsoft Teams for your needs - Business Plans](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-teams/compare-microsoft-teams-business-options).

To view Microsoft Teams (free) features, see [Find the right Microsoft Teams for your needs - Home Plans](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-teams/compare-microsoft-teams-home-options).

## Administration limits and specifications for Microsoft Teams Essentials

See [Microsoft Teams limits and specifications](/microsoftteams/limits-specifications-teams) to learn more about the limits, specifications, and other requirements that apply to Teams.

## Get Microsoft Teams Essentials

Is your business new to Microsoft Teams? Thanks for choosing Microsoft!

To get started with Teams Essentials, follow these steps:

1. **Purchase the subscription.** Go to [Microsoft Teams Essentials for small business](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-teams/compare-microsoft-teams-options) and select **Buy now** under Microsoft Teams Essentials.
2. **Sign up with your existing email address.** Use an existing email address and follow the instructions to purchase user licenses.
3. **Review Teams service description.** Visit [Microsoft Teams service description](/office365/servicedescriptions/teams-service-description) to learn more about Microsoft Teams.

When you complete these tasks, you're ready to plan, deploy, and use the Teams app.

To do that, complete these three steps:

1. **Install the Teams app.** Install the Teams client on your PC or mobile device by going to [Download Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-teams/download-app).

2. **Get Familiar with Teams.** The best way to become familiar with Teams is to start using it right away. Take some time to explore the application so you have a better understanding of its capabilities.

3. **Plan for adoption.** For small businesses, planning for user adoption can be as simple as individually showing your users how to use Teams. Often, small business customers don't consider this step for new applications, which negatively affects the application's success and adoption.

4. **Manage Microsoft Teams Essentials.** Any Teams (free) users who upgraded to Microsoft Teams Essentials can manage it.

Managing Microsoft Teams Essentials refers to assigning Microsoft Teams Essentials seats to other users - on whose behalf you purchased - in the intended proportions. You can manage Microsoft Teams Essentials through the Microsoft admin center.

### Upgrade from Teams (free) to Microsoft Teams Essentials

If your organization is using a free version of Microsoft Teams, you can easily upgrade to the Teams Essentials version by purchasing a plan for your users directly in Teams from [Find the right Microsoft Teams for your needs](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-teams/compare-microsoft-teams-options).

### Limitations

Keep the following limitations in mind:

- All users must be in the same domain. (All users get a sign-in email in the format *username*@*domain.com*.)
