# Allow users to record their name when they join a meeting in Microsoft Teams

When you set up Audio Conferencing in Microsoft 365 or Office 365, you get phone numbers for your users through an audio conferencing bridge. A conferencing bridge can have one or more phone numbers that are included at the bottom of the meeting invite. These phone numbers allow users to join Microsoft Teams meetings by dialing in.

As an admin, you can manage whether callers who dial in can record their name before joining a meeting.

## Allow callers to record their name in the Teams admin center

Using the Microsoft Teams admin center:

1. Navigate to **Meetings** > **Conference Bridges**.

2. At the top of the **Conference Bridges** page, select **Bridge settings**.

3. Toggle **Meeting entry and exit notifications** to on.

4. For **Entry/exit announcement type** select **Names or phone numbers** from the dropdown.

5. Toggle **Ask callers to record their name before joining a meeting** to **On**.

6. Select **Save**.

## Manage whether callers can record their names with PowerShell

To manage whether callers can record their names with PowerShell, use the **`-EnableNameRecording`**. **`-EntryExitAnnouncementsType`**, and **`-EnableNameRecording`** parameters, within the PowerShell [Set-CsOnlineDialInConferencingTenantSettings](/powershell/module/teams/set-csonlinedialinconferencingtenantsettings) cmdlet.

### Prevent callers from recording their names

To prevent callers from recording their names, use the following script:

```powershell
Set-CsOnlineDialInConferencingTenantSettings -EnableEntryExitNotifications $false -EnableNameRecording $false
```

### Allow callers to record their names

To allow callers to record their names, use the following script:

```powershell
Set-CsOnlineDialInConferencingTenantSettings -EnableEntryExitNotifications $true -EntryExitAnnouncementsType UseNames -EnableNameRecording $true
```
